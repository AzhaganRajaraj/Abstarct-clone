            <p style="background-color: orchid; color: red;"> The language of
                the
                Atharvaveda is different from Rigvedic
                Sanskrit,
                preserving pre-Vedic Indo-European archaisms.[7][6] It is a
                collection of 730 hymns with about 6,000 mantras, divided into
                books.[6] About a sixth of the Atharvaveda texts adapt verses
                from
                the Rigveda, and except for Books 15 and 16, the text is mainly
                in
                verse deploying a diversity of Vedic meters.[6] Two different
                recensions of the text the Paippalāda and the Śaunakīya have
                survived into modern times.[8] Reliable manuscripts of the
                Paippalada edition were believed to have been lost, but a
                well-preserved version was discovered among a collection of palm
                leaf manuscripts in Odisha in 1957.[8]<br>
                The Atharvaveda is sometimes called the
                "Veda of magical formulas",[3] a description considered
                incorrect by
                other scholars.[9] In contrast to the 'hieratic religion' of the
                other three Vedas, the Atharvaveda is said to represent a
                'popular religion', incorporating not only formulas for magic,
                but
                also the daily rituals for initiation into learning (upanayana),
                marriage and funerals. Royal rituals and the duties of the court
                priests are also included in the Atharvaveda.[10] <br>
                The Atharvaveda was likely compiled as a Veda contemporaneously
                with
                Samaveda and Yajurveda, or about 1200 BCE – 1000 BCE.[11][12]
                Along
                with the Samhita layer of text, the Atharvaveda includes a
                Brahmana
                text, and a final layer of the text that covers philosophical
                speculations. The latter layer of Atharvaveda text includes
                three
                primary Upanishads, influential to various schools of Hindu
                philosophy. These include the Mundaka Upanishad, the Mandukya
                Upanishad and the Prashna Upanishad.[13][14]

                commercially
                successful actors in Tamil cinema. Following a period of
                moderate

                first Indian music video to cross 100 million views on
                YouTube.[10]
                He made his Hindi film debut with Aanand L. Rai's Raanjhanaa
                (2013).
                His performance as an obsessive one-sided lover in the film won
                him
                the Filmfare Award for Best Male Debut in addition to a
                nomination
                for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor.[11] Dhanush produces
                films
                through his production company, Wunderbar Films, and made his
                directorial debut with Pa Paandi (2017).[12][13] His song
                "Rowdy Baby" from Maari 2 became one of the most-viewed Indian
                songs

                reach one billion views on YouTube.[16] Dhanush won his second
                National Film Award for Best Actor for Asuran (2019).[17]

            <p style="background-color: gray; color: violet;">
                During college, Sivakarthikeyan took part in various cultural
                events
                and performed mimicry and standup comedy onstage.[10] Between
                his
                studies, he took a three month-break, and during this period,
                his
                friends convinced him to go for auditions of Kalakka Povathu
                Yaaru?,
                a comedy reality TV show airing on Star Vijay. He started his
                career
                as a mimicry artist. Despite initial reluctance to participate,
                he
                won the second season of the show in 2006.[11] The makers of
                Aegan
                (2008) noticed Sivakarthikeyan and offered him a supporting role
                in
                the film, but his portions did not make the final cut.[12] He
                appeared in short films, including his friend Atlee's
                Mugaputhagam,[13] Identity, Kurahl 786, and 360°.<br>
                Director Pandiraj approached Sivakarthikeyan to play the lead
                role
                in his film Marina (2012), and he signed the project. He
                prepared
                for the role by paying close attention to Pandiraj's
                instructions
                and visiting Marina Beach extensively to study the surroundings,
                while revealing that he hoped that his natural talent of humor
                would
                come through onscreen.[14] Featuring alongside Oviya as a young
                couple in the film, Sivakarthikeyan's performance was
                well-received,
                with a critic noting
                "the romance adds colour to a monochrome film",
                while the reviewer also noted that the
                "role of Senthilnathan requires Siva to be just himself, it is just a cake walk in terms of performance for this actor."[15]<br>
                Prior to Marina's release, Aishwarya Rajinikanth had signed
                Sivakarthikeyan up to play a supporting role as Dhanush's friend
                in
                3, after being impressed with his work onstage as a host.[16]
                Following significant pre-release hype, the film opened to
                predominantly positive reviews with critics appreciating
                Sivakarthikeyan's work providing comic relief in a serious
                film.[17]
                The project also marked the beginning of an association with
                Dhanush, whom Sivakarthikeyan has often stated is his mentor in
                the
                film industry.<br>
                He was next seen in Ezhil's romantic comedy Manam Kothi Paravai
                later that same year, which opened to mixed reviews but had a
                decent
                run at the box office. A critic from Behindwoods noted that the
                film
                "might not provide Sivakarthikeyan the platform he is aspiring for – lead roles in movies. But it does showcase his potential as an actor."[18]

            <p style="background-color: #00b7eb; color: #a52a2a;">
                In 2010, Silambarasan sang the song "Evan Di Unna Pethan," with
                music composed by Yuvan Shankar Raja and lyrics jointly written
                by
                Silambarasan and Yuvan, as a part of the soundtrack album for
                his
                film Vaanam and the song faced severe opposition for its
                provocative
                lyrics. A women's rights organisation in Chennai criticised the
                lyrics and issued a statement to Silambarasan for the lyrics
                being
                "chauvinistic" that "demean women". Further it was argued that
                "music needs to appeal to larger sections than to the ‘thrill-seeking’ youth who are often misguided into ‘cheap thrills’ because of such songs",
                demanding censorship.[44] However, several prominent people from
                the
                film industry came to support Silambarasan stating that there
                have
                been more objectionable scenes in films in the past and that
                there
                were "bigger issues in society" and applying censorship was not
                "the ideal way out in democracy."[44]<br>
                After releasing a promotional version of "The Love Anthem" song
                in
                2011, Silambarasan announced that a final version would be
                released
                thereafter and announced his desire to bring in international
                artists Akon and Rihanna for the venture.[45] He subsequently
                headed
                to Los Angeles in January 2012 and recorded an original version
                of
                the song by himself at Studio Zappa with music producer Elan
                Morrison on the keyboards.[46] The failure to sign in the
                international artists prompted the project's producer,
                Silambarasan's father T. Rajendar to lodge a police complaint
                against two agents who had misled his production company into
                supposed connections with the international artists concerned.
                Rajendar noted that the sound editor Ramji Soma and a Canadian
                entrepreneur Talvinder Bathh had charged Rs 12 million
                ($200,000)
                from his company and failed to return it despite promises made
                to
                sign on Akon, David Guetta and either Rihanna or Nicole
                Scherzinger
                for the project.[47] In May 2013, Silambarasan was finally
                successfully able to bring in Akon to collaborate for an
                alternate
                version of the song, with the move being facilitated by
                Tracktical
                Entertainment.[48] The latest version of the song is yet to be
                released, with Silambarasan hinting in early 2014 that the song
                may
                be launched before the end of 2014.[49] In an interview in June
                2015, he revealed that the venture would be resumed soon, though
                that he was busy with other commitments.[50]<br>
                In December 2015, a song, referred to by the media as the
                "Beep Song" was leaked online and was widely circulated. The
                song
                was initially reported to be written and sung by Silambarasan
                and
                composed by music director Anirudh Ravichander, and featured an
                expletive degrading women which had been beeped out.
                Subsequently,
                Anirudh denied any involvement in the song and Silambarasan
                clarified that he had written, composed and sung the song
                himself,
                stating he was unsure how the song was leaked and uploaded onto
                the
                internet.[51] The song provoked widespread criticism from
                pressure
                groups and film personalities. <br>Women activists organised
                protests in front of Silambarasan house in T. Nagar and other
                places.[52] Meanwhile, the Left-wing of All India Democratic
                Women's
                Association (AIDWA) alleged that the song was sexist and
                derogatory
                to women and filed a case against Silambarasan in coimbatote.

                Kumaravadivel Natarajan (born 12 September 1960) known
                professionally as Vadivelu, is an Indian actor, comedian and
                occasional playback singer, having acted mainly in Tamil cinema.
                He
                has at least 290 credits to his name. He was a recipient of
                several
                awards including two Filmfare Award South and six Tamil Nadu
                State
                Film Awards.<br>
                He was launched in 1988, in T. Rajendar's En Thangai Kalyani at
                the
                career peak of the Goundamani-Senthil duo.[6] His popularity led
                to
                his media-coined nickname, Vaigai Puyal,[7] referring to the
                river
                that flows through his hometown Madurai.<br>
                Vadivelu has received awards in the Best Comedian category for
                his
                performances in Kaalam Maari Pochu (1996), Vetri Kodi Kattu
                (2000),

                His first as a lead actor, Imsai Arasan 23rd Pulikesi (2006),
                also
                achieved commercial and critical success. His comedic portrayals
                have been critiqued as using the persona of a misunderstood,
                mistreated Subaltern rogue, often subject to on-screen violence
                and
                ridicule in the style of slapstick comedy.<br>
                Images and videography of Vadivelu's expressions found a second
                life
                despite the corresponding dormancy in his career during the
                2010s in
                Indian Internet subcultures.[10][6] In 2017, The News Minute
                reported,
                "Vadivelu's career is not what it used to be but Tamil Nadu still turns to him for a laugh or to a summarize a situation in one line."[11]
                In 2019, Vadivelu was featured in the sudden viral memes related
                to
                the hashtag Pray for Nesamani which was the most trending
                hashtag in
                India during the year.[12]

                Ramalakshmanan Muthuchamy (born 27 August 1977),[1]
                professionally
                known as Soori, is an Indian actor and comedian who
                predominantly
                appears in Tamil cinema. Debuting in 1998, he acted in several
                uncredited roles before his major breakthrough in Vennila Kabadi
                Kuzhu (2009), where he earned the moniker Parotta Soori. After a
                decade as a comedian, his dramatic turn as a lead actor in
                Vetrimaaran's Viduthalai Part 1 (2023) received critical
                acclaim.
                Soori moved from Madurai to Chennai in 1996 with the intention
                of
                becoming an actor in the Tamil film industry. After failing to
                get
                any roles, he took up work in the city as a cleaner to fund his
                acting ambitions.<br>
                He played occasional uncredited roles in films as a junior
                artiste,
                appearing especially in comedy scenes, such as in Winner
                (2003).[2]
                and thereafter Ezhil's Deepavali.<br>
                Soori notably appeared in the critical and commercial hit film
                Vennila Kabadi Kuzhu (2009). The suffix "parotta" was soon
                attached
                to his name because of the film's famous 'parotta competition'
                scene, in which Soori's character stuns a hotelier by eating 50
                parottas and getting ready to eat the same number once again.[3]
                He
                later appeared in a number of films in well-received comedic and
                sidekick roles, such as Poraali (2011), Sundarapandian (2012),
                Varuthapadatha Valibar Sangam (2013), and Jilla (2014).[4] His
                supporting roles were also praised in Rajini Murugan (2016) Idhu
                Namma Aalu (2016), Velainu Vandhutta Vellaikaaran (2016), and
                Sangili Bungili Kadhava Thorae (2017).
                In 2018, he was seen in both Sivakarthikeyan's Seema Raja and
                Vikram's Saamy Square. However, his comedic performances in
                these
                two films were heavily criticised, prompting Soori himself to
                respond.[5] He went on to have back-to-back releases with the
                successful Namma Veettu Pillai (2019) and the panned
                Sangathamizhan
                (2019).[6]<br>
                In 2023, Soori was cast against type as the main protagonist of
                Vetrimaaran's period crime thriller, Viduthalai Part 1. His
                performance garnered highly positive appreciation from critics
                as
                well as audiences.[7] This was followed by leading roles in
                Garudan
                (2024), a neo-noir action film, and Kottukkaali (2024), a
                drama-comedy about caste, as well as Yezhu Kadal Yezhu Malai
                (2024),
                a period-bending romantic drama. All three films widely received
                critical acclaim for their direction and performances, with
                Kottukkali and Yezhu Kadal Yezhu Malai being screened at the
                74th
                Berlin International Film Festival and the 53rd International
                Film
                Festival Rotterdam respectively.

                with
                the Kannada romantic comedy Kirik Party (2016) and gained
                further
                commercial success with the action film Anjani Putra and the

                with
                the comedy drama Chalo (2018) and had her breakthrough with the
                romantic comedy Geetha Govindam (2018), which earned her the
                Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actress – Telugu. She went on to
                star as the leading lady in the action comedies Sarileru
                Neekevvaru
                (2020) and Bheeshma (2020).<br>
