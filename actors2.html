        <p style="background-color: orchid; color: red;"> The language of
            the
            Atharvaveda is different from Rigvedic
            Sanskrit,
            preserving pre-Vedic Indo-European archaisms.[7][6] It is a
            collection of 730 hymns with about 6,000 mantras, divided into
            books.[6] About a sixth of the Atharvaveda texts adapt verses
            from
            the Rigveda, and except for Books 15 and 16, the text is mainly
            in
            verse deploying a diversity of Vedic meters.
